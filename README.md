# What is DevOps
## Why DevOps

### Benefits of DevOps

**Four pillars of DevOps best practice**
- Ease of Use (Human interaction)
- Flexibility (When client wants more features at the end of a sprint,, we are flexible to add these)
- Robustness - Faster delivery of product
- Cost - Cost Effective (minimising cost by automating, CI/CD etc..)

### Monolith, 2 tier and Microservices Architectures
Monolith  
(One box that has the front end, back end, database)  
(Everytime you add a feature, you have to restart the entire program)  
(Uptime, responce time, etc..)  

2 tier  
(breaking it down into smaller things with AWS)

Microservices
(Separating it into even smaller things for improved uptime, and easier updating)
